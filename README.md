# Milestone 7: Backend User Login Endpoint with Password Validation 🔐

## Overview 📌
This milestone focuses on building a **secure login endpoint** for user authentication. The process includes **validating user credentials** and securely comparing the provided password with the **encrypted password** stored in the database. 

The implementation follows industry standards for **privacy** and **data protection**, ensuring a reliable and robust login system.

---

## Features 🚀
### 1. **User Login Endpoint**
   - Accepts **email/username** and **password** as inputs.
   - Validates user existence and authenticates credentials.

### 2. **Password Encryption & Comparison**
   - Utilized **bcrypt** for password hashing and comparison.
   - Ensured user passwords are protected even if the database is compromised.

### 3. **Secure Authentication Process**
   - Step-by-step approach:
     1. Fetch user data based on the provided email/username.
     2. If the user does not exist, return an error: *"User does not exist."*
     3. Hash the entered password using bcrypt and compare it with the stored hash.
     4. If the hashes match, the user is successfully authenticated; otherwise, return an error.

---

## Why Password Encryption Matters 🔒
### 1. **Protects User Data**:
   - Prevents the exposure of plain-text passwords in case of a data breach.
### 2. **Complies with Security Standards**:
   - Adheres to regulations like GDPR and PCI-DSS.
### 3. **Enhances Security**:
   - Hashed passwords are **one-way encrypted**, making it challenging to reverse-engineer them.

---

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Node.js/Express**: For creating the backend API.
- **bcrypt**: For password hashing and secure comparison.
- **Database (e.g., MongoDB)**: For user record storage.

- Setting up Redux in a React project  
- Creating a Redux store to manage global state  
- Writing and dispatching actions  
- Accessing global state across different components



### 2. Created the Store Folder

I made a new folder called `store` and added two files inside it:
- `store.js` — to define and configure the Redux store
- `userActions.js` — to handle user-related actions

---

### 3. Configured the Redux Store



### 4. Wrote the Action Function


### 5. Connected Redux to the App


## 📌 Highlight

The Redux store now holds the **user email** as global state, which can be accessed or updated from any component in the app. Super useful for things like login systems, dashboards, or user profiles.

## ✅ Done and Dusted!

This milestone helped me understand the core idea of global state and how Redux fits into the picture. Looking forward to building more complex state flows using this setup!

Let me know if you’d like a version with code examples using `useSelector` and `useDispatch` next!


Absolutely! Here’s your updated README with a more personal and engaging tone using **"I did"** throughout:

## **🌟 Milestone 32: Going Global with Redux! 🌍** ##

Welcome to **Milestone 32** — a major step forward in making my app smarter and more connected using **Redux** for global state management. Let’s dive into what I did! 💪

---

## 🚀 What I Did

In this milestone, I:

- Used **Redux** to store the **user’s email globally**
- Accessed the stored email across multiple pages
- Learned how to use **`dispatch`** to update state and **`useSelector`** to retrieve it  
- Took a big leap in mastering global state management in React

---

## 🛠️ How I Did It

### 1️⃣ Stored the Email from Login Page


### 2️⃣ Accessed the Email Anywhere


## 💡 What I Learned

By doing this, I understood:

- How to avoid prop drilling
- How Redux helps in managing data across the app
- The value of a centralized state for a seamless user experience

---

## 🎉 Mission Accomplished!

With Milestone 32 completed, I’ve added another powerful tool to my React toolkit. Managing global state with Redux? ✅ Done and dusted!

## **Milestone 34: Validating JWT Tokens from Cookies** ##
🛡️ JWT Token Validation for Protected Routes  

🌟 **Overview**  

This milestone focuses on securing your application by validating the JWT tokens stored in cookies. You’ll ensure only authenticated users can access certain pages, forming the backbone of protected routes and user-based access control.

✨ **Features**  

🍪 Extract JWT token from the browser cookie.  
🔍 Send the token to the backend for validation.  
✅ Middleware checks token authenticity and validity.  
🚫 Prevents access to routes without proper authentication.  

📝 **Implementation Steps**  

🔍 **Get Token from Cookie**  

📨 **Send Token to Backend**  

🧠 **Create JWT Middleware**  


🚫 **Redirect Unauthorized Users**  
If token verification fails, redirect the user to the login page or return a 401 Unauthorized response.

🚀 **Next Steps**  
With token validation in place, you’re now ready to implement full session management and user-specific pages with robust access control.
